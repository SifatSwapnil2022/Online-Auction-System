# Online-Auction-System
An online auction platform wants to enhance its bidding process and ensure fair competition among participants. To achieve this, a multi-threaded C program with semaphores, processes, threads, and mutex locks can be developed.
The problem to be addressed involves:
 Coordinating bid submissions and updates in real-time to reflect the latest highest bids
and auction status.
 Managing concurrent access to auction listings and user accounts to prevent bid
manipulation and fraud.
 Synchronizing auction events and closing times to facilitate a transparent and efficient
bidding process.
By implementing this system, the online auction platform can foster trust and credibility among
users, leading to increased participation and successful transactions.
